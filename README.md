# FireBase App using Flutter <br>
I made this app to learn basic CRUD operations and Authentication in Firebase<br>
In this app you can sign in using phone number or email<br>
After loggin in,you can add some information and store it on the Firebase realtime database
The data can be Edited and deleted as per user's request
